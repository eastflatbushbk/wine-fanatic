review3 = Review.create(user_id: user2.id, wine_id: wine5.id, comment: "great wine !! taste great with a nice steak!! Covalli Barolo is a wine that is made from Nebbiolo grapes grown in the Piedmont region of Italy. The 2017 Covalli Barolo DOCG is a classically styled wine that shows the tightrope balance of concentration and buoyancy that we love to find in a Barolo. It brings all the power and grace we expect from Piedmont‚Äôs signature wine, making it the perfect bottle for anyone who loves elegant, soulful reds1. The wine has a deep ruby color and aromas of dark fruit, leather, and spice. On the palate, it is full-bodied with flavors of black cherry, plum, and licorice. The tannins are firm but not overpowering, and the finish is long and smooth.

The 2016 Covalli Nebbiolo (Barolo) has a rating of 91 points on Wine Enthusiast. Nebbiolo produces wines with tannic and acidic qualities that can also have fairly high alcohol content. This combination makes the distinguished and cellar-worthy wines of Barolo and Barberesco some of the most sought-after.

Overall, Covalli Barolo is an excellent wine that is sure to impress even the most discerning wine connoisseur. It is perfect for pairing with hearty meat dishes or aged cheeses")

review5 = Review.create(user_id: user4.id, wine_id: wine1.id, comment: "i need me a bottle asap!! The Pinot Project Pinot Noir is a California wine that is hand-crafted from grapes grown in notable AVA‚Äôs such as Sonoma County, Carneros & Monterey. It has a full and silky mouth feel, with just the right amount of acidity to complement a variety of dishes1. The Pinot Project Pinot Noir 2019 is very balanced, has a chewy fruit core and great acidity. It has all the characteristics that define the state‚Äôs broad style. Chill this bottle for twenty minutes, and sip it with a big o‚Äôl juicy burger.

According to Wine Enthusiast, the 2020 Pinot Noir from The Pinot Project is beautiful with fresh fruit flavors that light up this no-nonsense wine, delivering the varietal‚Äôs classic red and black cherries, along with light cinnamon nuances and a good, lightly tannic texture. It‚Äôs easy to quaff and interesting too")
